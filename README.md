## 🌍 Overview  

FocusOps is a simple, open framework that helps small teams and founders create clarity, align around priorities, and execute consistently.  

It’s not a tool — it’s a set of principles, templates, and rhythms that help you:  
- See what truly matters  
- Translate ideas into action  
- Build focus and momentum week after week

## 🧩 Core Principles  

1. **Clarity before speed**  
2. **Less noise, more flow**  
3. **Consistent alignment**
