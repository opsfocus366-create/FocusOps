# Clarity Audit (Quick Guide)

The goal of a Clarity Audit is to identify what truly matters â€” and cut the noise.

## ðŸ§­ Steps
1. Define your short-term outcome (what must be true in the next 2 weeks).
2. List all active projects or tasks.
3. Mark which ones directly contribute to that outcome.
4. Pause, delegate, or drop anything that doesnâ€™t.
5. Confirm owners and next steps.

**Output:** 3 clear priorities, owners, and a next review date.

> Clarity before speed. Once everyone sees the same picture, execution becomes natural.
