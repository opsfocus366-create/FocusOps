# Decision-Making System (FocusOps Module)

> Clarity speeds up decisions. Confusion multiplies meetings.

---

## 🧭 Purpose
Help teams make clear, confident decisions quickly — without endless debates or circular discussions.

---

## ⚙️ Framework

### 1️⃣ Define the Decision
- What exactly needs to be decided?
- Who owns the outcome?

### 2️⃣ Define the Criteria
- What matters most in this decision? (e.g., speed, quality, impact)
- What constraints exist? (budget, time, people)

### 3️⃣ Decide and Record
- Choose based on the criteria, not opinions.
- Write the decision down and share it in the team doc.
- Include the rationale — not to justify, but to create clarity for future reference.

---

## 🧩 Tips
- If a decision takes more than two meetings, redefine the question.
- If no one owns the outcome, it’s not a decision — it’s a discussion.
- Default to small, reversible decisions. They keep momentum alive.

## 💬 FocusOps Principle
> “Decisions are clarity in motion.”  
When teams make decisions fast and visibly, everything else flows.
